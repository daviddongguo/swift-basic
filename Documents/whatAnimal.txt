Imagine yourself walking through a dense forest, surrounded by tall trees and the soothing sound of birds chirping. As you continue walking, you suddenly catch sight of a quaint little cottage nestled amidst the greenery.

You approach the cottage and notice a massive tree standing in front of it. The tree's trunk is thick and gnarled, and its branches extend out in all directions, providing shade to the surrounding area. Underneath the tree, there is a vast meadow stretching out as far as the eye can see. The meadow is covered in a myriad of colorful flowers, ranging from vibrant yellows to soft pinks.

As you move closer to the cottage, you realize that its door is wide open, inviting you to come inside. You enter the cozy little abode and notice a table in the center of the room. The table's shape is a perfect rectangle, and it is adorned with a crisp white tablecloth.

On the table, you spot a delicate vase filled with freshly picked flowers. There are twelve flowers in the vase, each one a different hue, ranging from deep reds to pale blues. The sweet fragrance of the flowers fills the air, making you feel even more at ease.

After admiring the beauty of the cottage's interior, you decide to explore the backyard. As you walk around to the back of the cottage, you discover a small river running alongside it. The river's shape is S-shaped, and the water flows swiftly, creating tiny ripples on its surface.

You dip your toes in the cool water and feel the soothing sensation of the gentle current. The sound of the river flowing and the birds singing in the background creates a tranquil ambiance, making you want to stay in this idyllic setting forever.
